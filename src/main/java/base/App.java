/* Exercise 21 - Numbers to Names
Many programs display information to the end user in one form but use a different form inside the program. For example,
you may show the word Blue on the screen, but behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that color or an
internal value because you may need to represent the textual description in another language for Spanish-speaking visitors.

Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the corresponding month. Prompt for a number and display
the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December. For any value outside that range, display
an appropriate error message.

Example Output

Please enter the number of the month: 3
The name of the month is March.

Constraints

Use a switch or case statement for this program.
Use a single output statement for this program.

Challenges

Use a map or dictionary to remove the switch statement from the program.
Support multiple languages. Prompt for the language at the beginning of the program.
